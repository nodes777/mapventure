#Project 5- Neighborhood Map#

A single page application featuring Port Douglas QLD, Australia. This application identifies several of my favorite places on the penisula.

In order to run the Neighborhood Map application, download the zip or clone the repository to your local machine, and open index.html. Type in the search bar to sort through available locations. Click on the icons on the map or in the list in order to view info windows.
